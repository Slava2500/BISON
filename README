Incomplete, in development.

Extension to ITFC file compressor (from another repo) using a new methodology,
the Binary Indicator Symbol Ordering Notation, to further reduce file size.

Input the output file from ITFC and generate large binary sequences built from the
occurence of common symbols to further compress the file by replacing these with
ascii tokens that represent blocks of these sequences.

Each such binary sequence represents 2 commonly found symbols. It is possible to
iterate and generate many such sequences for 2 symbols at a time, in turn each then
converted to compact ascii-base representation, until most or even all symbols in
original ITFC output file are processed.

Of course, final BISON app will incorporate ITFC to combine both compression stages
in one go.
